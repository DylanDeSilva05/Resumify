# Multi-Tenancy Implementation - Summary

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- ✅ Created `Company` model with subscription tiers and limits
- ✅ Added `company_id` to ALL data models (User, Candidate, JobPosting, CVAnalysis, Interview)
- ✅ Created migration script: `Backend/migrations/add_multi_tenancy.sql`
- ✅ Added foreign key constraints with CASCADE delete

### 2. User Role System
- ✅ Created new `UserRole` enum:
  - `SUPER_ADMIN` - You (can create companies)
  - `COMPANY_ADMIN` - Company owners (can create users)
  - `COMPANY_USER` - Regular employees
  - `RECRUITER` - Limited access

### 3. API Security Updates
- ✅ Updated `/api/v1/candidates/` - Now filters by company_id
- ✅ Updated `/api/v1/candidates/{id}` - Company-scoped access
- ✅ Updated `/api/v1/analysis/upload-and-analyze` - Auto-sets company_id
- ✅ Updated `/api/v1/analysis/results/{id}` - Company-scoped access
- ✅ Updated `/api/v1/analysis/candidates/{status}` - Company-filtered

### 4. New Company Management Endpoints
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/companies/` - Create company (super admin only)
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/companies/` - List all companies (super admin only)
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/companies/{id}` - Get company details
- ✅ `PUT /api/v1/companies/{id}` - Update company
- ✅ `DELETE /api/v1/companies/{id}` - Delete company (cascades)
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/companies/{id}/stats` - Company statistics
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/companies/my-company` - Get current user's company

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ Created `MULTI_TENANCY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete guide
- ✅ Created `Backend/migrations/README.md` - Migration instructions
- ✅ Added inline code comments explaining multi-tenant filters

## 🚀 Next Steps (What YOU Need to Do)

### Step 1: Backup Your Database ⚠️
```bash
pg_dump -U your_username -d resumify > backup_before_migration.sql
```

### Step 2: Run the Migration
```bash
cd Backend
psql -U your_username -d resumify -f migrations/add_multi_tenancy.sql
```

### Step 3: Make Yourself Super Admin
```sql
UPDATE users
SET role = 'super_admin'::userrole,
    company_id = NULL
WHERE id = 1;  -- Or your user ID
```

### Step 4: Restart Your Backend Server
```bash
# Stop current server
# Restart with your usual command (uvicorn, gunicorn, etc.)
```

### Step 5: Test the System

#### Create a Test Company:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/companies/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "company_name": "Test Company",
    "contact_email": "test@company.com",
    "subscription_tier": "premium",
    "max_users": 10
  }'
```

#### Create a Company Admin:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "company_admin",
    "email": "admin@testcompany.com",
    "full_name": "Company Admin",
    "password": "password123",
    "company_id": 1,
    "role": "company_admin"
  }'
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Before (INSECURE):
```
User from Company A → Upload CV → Database
User from Company B → List all CVs → Sees Company A's CVs ❌
```

### After (SECURE):
```
User from Company A → Upload CV → Database (company_id=A)
User from Company B → List all CVs → Only sees Company B's CVs ✅
```

### Example Query (Before):
```python
# ❌ NO FILTERING - Shows all companies' data
candidates = db.query(Candidate).all()
```

### Example Query (After):
```python
# ✅ FILTERED BY COMPANY - Shows only user's company data
candidates = db.query(Candidate)\
  .filter(Candidate.company_id == current_user.company_id)\
  .all()
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Your Workflow (As Super Admin):

1. **Receive email from interested company**: "ABC Corp wants to use Resumify"

2. **Create their company**:
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/companies/
   {
     "company_name": "ABC Corp",
     "contact_email": "admin@abccorp.com",
     "subscription_tier": "premium",
     "max_users": 20
   }
   ```

3. **Create their admin account**:
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/users/
   {
     "username": "abc_admin",
     "email": "admin@abccorp.com",
     "company_id": 2,  # The company ID from step 2
     "role": "company_admin",
     "password": "temp_password"
   }
   ```

4. **Send credentials to ABC Corp** via email

5. **ABC Corp admin can now**:
   - Login to their account
   - Create employee accounts
   - Upload CVs
   - Analyze candidates
   - All their data is isolated from other companies ✅

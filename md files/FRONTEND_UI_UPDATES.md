## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why do I see "Loading..." on Company Profile?**
A: The page is fetching your actual company data from the database. It should load within 1-2 seconds.

**Q: Can I change the company name?**
A: Not yet through UI. For now, super admins need to use the API or database directly. We can add edit functionality later.

**Q: Why can't I create a Company Admin?**
A: If you're a Company Admin yourself, you don't have permission. Only Super Admins can create other Company Admins.

**Q: What if Company Profile shows "Default Company"?**
A: That's your current company! When you migrate, all existing data was assigned to "Default Company". You can create new companies through the API.
